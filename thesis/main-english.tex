This work introduces a new tool that can be used to find secure parameters for schemes based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) and the Short Integer Solution (SIS). Since the proposal of worst-case to average-case reductions from certain hard lattice problems to SIS and LWE respectively, both SIS and LWE have led to a plethora of cryptograpic schemes. Lattice based cryptography is highly in demand particularly in the context of post-quantum cryptography, as the era of quantum computing will render several popular schemes, such as RSA, insecure. To use LWE and SIS in practice, we first must establish their concrete hardness, given a set of paramters, by applying runtime estimates for the currently best known algorithms that solve LWE and SIS. This has been done for LWE in the LWE Estimator by Albrecht et al. (2015) and subsequent works. However, at this point, there is no unified tool that provides estimates for both LWE and SIS as well as their ring and module variants.

We aim to close this gap with a new Python library. Our tool includes previous estimates for LWE from the LWE Estimator and adds new attack estimates for SIS. In this thesis, we give an overview of the LWE and SIS problems and describe various algorithms that that can be used to solve them. In addition, we present important cost models that many estimates rely on from the literature. At the core of our tool is a generic paramter search function that is both simple to use and allows for extensive customization. Our tool supports several problem variants in all $\ell_p$-norms, norm bound estimates and distribution classes.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The rise of quantum computing promises great progress in areas that are considered to be very difficult for classical computers. At the same time, it poses a threat to cybersecurity, as some widely used cryptographic schemes that are assumed to be secure for classical computers no longer are secure in the era of quantum computing. The idea of quantum computing began in the early 1980's with a quantum mechanical model of a Turing machine by Paul Benioff \cite{benioff1980computer}. It soon became clear that quantum computing has a great advantage over classical computing in certain applications. In 1994, Peter Shor proposed algorithms to solve the problems of integer factorization and discrete logarithms in polynomial time \cite{Shor97}. As a result, cryptographic schemes that rely on the hardness of either of those assumptions, such as RSA, can be efficiently broken by quantum computers. Another popular algorithm that we will refer to later on, Grover's search algorithm (1996), leads to a quadratic speedup of search on unstructured data \cite{Gro96}.
Recent years have shown increasing interest and investments into quantum computing both by startups and large corporations like Google and IBM. For example, only a few months ago, Europe's most powerful 27-Qubit IBM Quantum System One was inaugurated in Ehningen, Germany \cite{IBM}. The current standard of technology, however, is still at a relatively immature stage and therefore, quantum computers are mainly used for academic purposes. The realization of fully capable quantum computers is not expected to happen for at least another five to ten years.
% Quantum computing promises great advantage over classical computing in the areas of machine learning, the modelling and understanding of biochemical processes and the like.
Nevertheless, particularly in the area of cryptography, we need new secure encryption schemes that can replace previous schemes and are based on different and stronger hardness assumptions. One solution that has gained great popularity over the last two decades is lattice-based cryptography.


The concept of lattices has been applied in cryptography since the end of the last century. Lattice reduction algorithms, such as the LLL algorithm, resulted in a number of new practical attacks on popular cryptosystems \cite{NV10}. Then, in 1996, the landmark work of Ajtai \cite{Ajt96} laid a foundation for a new family of cryptosystems. He showed that any instance of a certain lattice problem, namely, the approximate Shortest Vector Problem (SVP$_\gamma$), can be reduced to a randomized instance of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. This implies that an average-case SIS instance is at least as hard as a worst-case instance of SVP$_\gamma$, leading to very strong security guarantees. Later, Regev came up with a similar worst-case to average-case reduction for the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem \cite{Reg05}. SIS and LWE can be applied to create advanced cryptographic primitives, even some that seemed infeasible before. The SIS problem can be used to build one-way functions \cite{Ajt96, MR04}, collision resistant hash functions \cite{GGH96}, identity-based encryption schemes \cite{Lyu08} and digital signature schemes \cite{LM08, GPV08}. LWE is even more powerful than SIS and leads to a number of public-key encryption schemes \cite{Reg05, PW08, LPR10}, identity-based encryption schemes \cite{GPV08, ABB10}, somewhat and fully homomorphic encryption schemes \cite{Gen09a,BV11,GSW13} and more.
In addition to good security guarantees and an abundance of applications, the required key sizes are relatively small (quasilinear) and we obtain good practical runtimes.

% - concrete hardness of LWE: attacks, runtime estimates,

To use LWE and SIS in practice, we first need to find a set of parameters to parameterize the problem instance used in scheme such that the chosen parameters satisfy a certain security requirement. We can measure the security of an instance by means of a bit security level $\texttt{sec}$. A security level of $\texttt{sec} = 128$ means that an attacker has to perform at least $2^\texttt{128}$ operations to solve the respective problem instance. In general, it is difficult to find hard lower bounds on the number of operations required to break a scheme. Even if they exist, they may not be realistic in practice and result in larger key sizes and therefore less efficient schemes than really needed. We therefore need a way to estimate the concrete hardness of LWE and SIS. This can be achieved by examining the runtime complexity of the currently best attack algorithms. \citet{APS15} and follow-up works such as \cite{Alb17,BBGS19} performed an in-depth study of the practical hardness of LWE and encapsulated their findings in the LWE Estimator\footnote{\url{https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-estimator/}}, which we will subsequently call \textit{estimator}. However, the \textit{estimator} does not include estimates for SIS, and specifying distributions is not very user-friendly as of now. In addition, it only returns costs for a fixed parameter set. A user must specify a search function by himself. In this work, we aim to fill this gap with a new Python library, which we call Lattice Parameter Estimation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/krebsni/a-tool-for-the-estimation-of-lattice-parameters}} and will subsequently refer to simply as \textit{tool}. Our tool can be used to generically search for secure parameter sets given a set of problem instances. We provide classes for LWE and SIS, their ring and module variants, and statistically secure variants where applicable. We also included more convenient distribution classes and classes for various $\ell_p$-norms and the canonical embedding, as cryptographic schemes oftentimes require some guarantees of bounds on operands. We use the \textit{estimator} for cost estimates for LWE instances and add three estimation algorithms for SIS instances.

\section{Organization}
In \cref{ch:preliminaries}, we introduce lattices, lattice problems and their variants and a number of mathematical tools that will be needed later on. We describe the main approaches and algorithms that we use in our tool to solve LWE and SIS in \cref{ch:algorithms}. We remark on the complexity of the algorithms, whenever feasible in the scope of our work, and present several lattice reduction cost models from the literature. Finally, in \cref{ch:tool}, we explain our tool in more detail and give an overview of the various functionalities and configuration options. The discussion in previous chapters, in particular, the presentation of reduction cost models in \cref{sec:costmodels}, aims to help users of our tool to be aware of the impact of configuration choices and to understand estimate results of our parameter search. % TODO: applications???

\chapter{Conclusion}
% TODO
In summary, we examined two important problems in modern cryptography, namely, LWE and SIS, and discussed various strategies and algorithms for solving both problems from a perspective of practical hardness estimation. Furthermore, we compiled a list of up-to-date reduction cost models from the literature. These cost models play a crucial role in predicting the behavior of attack algorithms that rely on a lattice reduction subroutine. We introduced a new unified and user-friendly tool that can be used to find secure parameters for a given cryptographic scheme. The tool includes all popular variants of LWE and SIS as well as respective cost estimation procedures, provides several utility classes and functions, and allows for detailed customization. A good choice of algorithms for initial parameter searches are Primal uSVP for LWE and Lattice Reduction for SIS, as they yield low cost estimates in sort time. The initial parameter set can then be adapted and the search run again with all algorithms for the final result.

\paragraph{Future Work.} In the future, our tool could be further extended with more estimation algorithms, particularly, for SIS. We included a very basic version of a combinatorial attack on SIS in the dual lattice \cite{MR09}. It should be possible to apply improvements to the BKW algorithm to the combinatorial attack and obtain more realistic estimates. Furthermore, the LWE Estimator \cite{APS15} has not been updated over the last two years. Recently, more accurate estimates of the Primal uSVP attack have been published in \cite{PV21}. In addition, we may see a major refactoring of the \textit{estimator} in terms of how distributions are handled. In our tool, we introduced wrapper classes for this purpose. In the case of an update, our tool may not be compatible with the new version of the estimator anymore and will need to be adapted accordingly.
Lastly, as of now, our tool does not provide a convenient way to specify custom estimate algorithms. This functionality could be included as part of the configuration class.
