abstract = {In this paper we propose the first provably secure public key encryption scheme based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, in which secrets and errors are sampled uniformly at random from a relatively small set rather than from the commonly used discrete Gaussian distribution. Using a uniform distribution, instead of a Gaussian, has the potential of improving computational efficiency a great deal due to its simplicity, thus making the scheme attractive for use in practice. At the same time our scheme features the strong security guarantee of being based on the hardness of worst-case lattice problems. After presenting the construction of our scheme we prove its security and propose asymptotic parameters. Finally, we compare our scheme on several measures to one of the most efficient LWE-based encryption schemes with Gaussian noise. We show that the expected efficiency improvement is debunked, due to the large blow-up of the parameter sets involved.},

    abstract = {We propose the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, solving an old open problem. Such a scheme allows one to compute arbitrary functions over encrypted data without the decryption key—i.e., given encryptions E ( m 1), ..., E ( m t ) of m 1, ..., m t, one can efficiently compute a compact ciphertext that encrypts f ( m 1, ..., m t ) for any efficiently computable function f . Fully homomorphic encryption has numerous applications. For example, it enables encrypted search engine queries—i.e., a search engine can give you a succinct encrypted answer to your (boolean) query without even knowing what your query was. It also enables searching on encrypted data; you can store your encrypted data on a remote server, and later have the server retrieve only files that (when decrypted) satisfy some boolean constraint, even though the server cannot decrypt the files on its own. More broadly, it improves the efficiency of secure multiparty computation. In our solution, we begin by designing a somewhat homomorphic "boostrappable" encryption scheme that works when the function f is the scheme's own decryption function. We then show how, through recursive self-embedding, bootstrappable encryption gives fully homomorphic encryption.},

  abstract="In this chapter we describe some of the recent progress in lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here. Another useful resource is the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser [49], which also contains a wealth of information on the computational complexity aspects of lattice problems.",
